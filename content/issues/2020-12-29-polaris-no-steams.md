The current issue has been resolved. Polaris is now fully functioning.
---

*Update* - streams have been rectified, however the application is no longer running. **This is a priority**.

---

*Update* - Removing SSL certification has caused the domain name to resolve incorrectly to bearly a podcast. To rectify this, point your browser to port 5050 to login as usual and streaming can resume.

---

*Investigating* - Currently the Polaris server is allowing access to the library, however it is unable to serve the files within the web-app or mobile clients.
